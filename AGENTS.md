When making changes always consult character, nation, geography and other cards. Use the `world/` folder and everything within the book's folder as context. Take into account plots and plot points, the overall plot vision and chapter context (whether current, previous or future chapters). Ensure that changes align with the overall vision and tone of the story. Additionally, consider the pacing, dialogue, and emotional impact of your edits to enhance the reader's experience.
