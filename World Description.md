### Setting
`Ambitions of Peace` is a novel set in the far future where humanity is a multi-galactic civilization.
In terms of genre, the book is what can be described as a space fantasy (galactic empires with magic and swords, space travel).
In this future, humanity hasn't advanced past medieval technology as the widespread use of magic has eliminated the need more anything more advanced than a perfectly balanced sword and a well fit piece of armor.
Humanity relies on magic to advance society, travel through space, communicate, wage war and basically everything else.
### Magic System
The magic system in `Ambitions of Peace` is simple.
In this universe, magic can be harnessed by any living thing - this includes, plants, fungi, animals etc. However, the amount of magic a person can use is limited by their life force/constitution and willpower. One can raise that limit by training their mind and body, which imposes a natural limit on the power of a single individual since humans have natural physical and mental limits. One can also hone their control over their magic which will soft-increase that limit - optimizing how much energy to expend for a given spell.
Using magic is not without cost and risk. The more complex/powerful the spell or force that the user wants to exert, the more life force they need to expend. This can lead to a varying degree of temporary consequences, such as fatigue, aging, loss of sense(s), organ malfunction. In cases of extreme overuse (such as using magic near the edge of their limit), the user can become permanently impaired or even die.
The same limits apply to animals and plants - a byson would technically have a larger magical potential than a rabbit.
Magic can also be stored and the quantities that can be pushed into an object depend on the materials that object is made of - e.g. a diamond ring can hold more magical energy than a paper doll. Thus, the amount stored is limited by the material's sturdiness.
